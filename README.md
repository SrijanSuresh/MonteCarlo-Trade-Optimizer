# Project Gameplan & Flowchart for RL Trading Agent with MC Simulations

## Phase 1: Data Preparation & Preprocessing

### Data Collection
- Source historical market data (prices, volumes, macroeconomic indicators)
- Include multiple asset classes (e.g., equities, commodities) to diversify simulations

### Feature Engineering
- Compute technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI, volatility)
- Normalize/standardize features for neural network input

### Train/Test Split
- Split data chronologically (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing)
- Reserve subset of test data for "black swan" scenarios (e.g., market crashes)

## Phase 2: Monte Carlo (MC) Simulations

### Model Selection
- Base Model: Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) for standard volatility
- Advanced Model: Stochastic volatility (e.g., Heston model) or jump-diffusion processes to simulate black swan events

### Generate Price Paths
- Simulate 10,000+ synthetic price paths with varying volatility regimes
- Inject rare events (e.g., -20% single-day drops) into subset of paths

### Risk Metrics
- Calculate Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, and Sortino ratio for each path

## Phase 3: RL Agent Design

### State Space
- Inputs: Time-series window of prices, volumes, technical indicators
- Context: Portfolio state (cash, holdings, risk exposure)

### Action Space
- Discrete actions: [Buy, Sell, Hold] with variable position sizes (e.g., 0-100% of capital)

### Reward Function
- Primary: Risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio over episode)
- Penalties: Transaction costs, excessive drawdowns, or over-leverage

## Phase 4: Neural Network Architecture

### Time-Series Encoder
- LSTM/Transformer: Process sequential data to capture temporal dependencies
- Output: Latent representation of market state

### Policy/Value Networks (PPO)
- Actor Network: Outputs action probabilities
- Critic Network: Estimates state value (baseline for advantage calculation)

### DQN Alternative
- Q-network to estimate action-value function with experience replay

## Phase 5: Training Loop

### Environment Setup
- Each MC-simulated price path acts as unique RL environment

### Episode Execution
- For each episode:
  - Agent observes state → selects action → executes trade → receives reward
  - Terminate episode on portfolio depletion or fixed time horizon (e.g., 252 trading days)

### PPO Optimization
- Collect trajectories → compute advantages → update policy with clipped objective
- Use Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) for variance reduction

### Risk-Aware Training
- Prioritize episodes with extreme market movements during replay (importance sampling)

## Phase 6: Evaluation & Deployment

### Validation
- Test agent on:
  - Unseen MC paths (including black swan scenarios)
  - Historical crisis periods (e.g., 2008, 2020 COVID crash)

### Benchmarking
- Compare against passive strategies (buy-and-hold) and heuristic rules (e.g., moving average crossover)

### Iteration
- Refine reward function, adjust network depth, or experiment with volatility models
